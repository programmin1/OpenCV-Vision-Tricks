# OpenCV-Vision-Tricks
Some OpenCV examples, as seen at last year's Maker Faire!

video2.py - use key l, r for left and right, s to toggle show image, and the bottom sliders to change parameters. Closer is lighter. Press 3 to generate 3d mesh.

laserPosition.py - attempt to see stereo vision distance with a red laser representing one pixel of second camera.

burn.py - burn lines into the screen.
